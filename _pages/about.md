I'm a research scientist in Generative AI. I recently obtained my Ph.D. in computer science from EPFL, advised by [Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en). I was also a Marie-Curie fellow as [EPFLInnovator](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/doctoral-studies-structure/customized-curricula/epflinnovators/).

**Research interests** Iâ€™m interested in deep generative models (Normalizing Flows, VAEs, GANs, Diffusion models, ...) and have used them in different applications: [image synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05134), [behavior prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10270) and [human motion prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05669).
I am also conducting research on analyzing failures of [trajectory prediction](https://s-attack.github.io) models of self-driving cars using generative models and adversarial attacks.

Previously, I obtained my MS and BS in computer science and electrical engineering at Sharif Univ. of Tech. I have also collaborated with the Toyota Research Institute ([TRI](https://www.tri.global)), completed research internships at [Disney Research](https://disneyresearch.com/) and Valeo, and co-founded Pathy. Feel free to check my LinkedIn for more information. A detailed CV/resume is available upon request.
